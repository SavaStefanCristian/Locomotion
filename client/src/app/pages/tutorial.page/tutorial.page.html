      <h2>Goal of the game</h2>
      <p>
        You see a random location in Google Street View. Your goal is to guess
        where in the world it is by placing a marker on the small map.
      </p>

      <h2>Basic flow</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The game has a fixed number of rounds (set in Settings).</li>
        <li>Each round you get a new Street View panorama.</li>
        <li>You can look around, move on the road (if Street View allows it),
          and search for clues: language, road signs, landscape, etc.</li>
        <li>When you have an idea, click on the small map to place your guess.</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Submit guess</strong> before the timer reaches zero.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After you submit, the game shows:
          <ul>
            <li>Your guess (blue marker).</li>
            <li>The correct location (green marker).</li>
            <li>A line between them and the distance in kilometers.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Points are higher when your guess is closer to the true location.</li>
        <li>If you do not place a guess before the time ends, you get 0 points for that round.</li>
        <li>Your total score is the sum of all round points.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Regions / game modes</h2>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>World</strong> – locations from anywhere on Earth with Street View coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Europe</strong> – locations roughly within Europe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You pick the region on the main menu before starting the game.
